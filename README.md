This is my class XI project.
This project is a basic GUI in C++ which predicts shapes of common inorganic compounds using VSEPR theory and also draws representative basic structures pertaining to that compound on the screen. 
This project predicts shape correctly for most of the compounds composed of s and p block elements such as H2O Xe2O2F2 PCl5 etc. which fall in the domain of VSEPR theory. It also tries to predict hybridization of the compound using VBT
The source code compiles with Turbo C++, so for those who run windows newer than xp can use [DosBox](http://www.dosbox.com/) to run TC and build this project.
